# General directions

1. Model Templates: Provide users with pre-defined model templates for common decision scenarios. These templates can serve as starting points,
including default parameters, descriptions, and normalizers, specific to certain domains or decision types. Users can then modify and customize these templates to fit their specific needs.

2. Model Documentation and Help: Include comprehensive documentation and help resources within your framework.
This should provide clear instructions on how to create, manage, and use different decision models.
Additionally, provide examples and best practices to guide users in making effective use of the framework.



5. Incorporate Machine Learning: Integrate machine learning techniques into your framework to enable the automatic learning and optimization of decision models.
This could involve training the model using historical data or implementing algorithms that adapt and improve over time based on user feedback.


6. Decision Sensitivity Analysis: Provide functionality for conducting sensitivity analysis to evaluate the robustness of decisions with respect to parameter variations.
This allows users to understand how changes in parameter values impact the overall decision outcomes.


7. Visualization and Reporting: Develop visualization capabilities to present decision-related information in a clear and intuitive manner.
This can include visualizing parameter distributions, comparing different datasets, or displaying the ranked results.
Additionally, generate comprehensive reports summarizing the decision-making process and results for easy reference.

8. Decision Collaboration: Enable collaboration among multiple users, allowing them to share datasets, models, and decision outcomes.
This facilitates collective decision-making, group discussions, and consensus-building among team members.


9. Integration with External Data Sources: Extend your framework to seamlessly integrate with external data sources, such as APIs or databases,
to provide users with up-to-date information for making decisions. This can include real-time market data, user reviews, or other relevant sources that influence the decision-making process.

10. Decision Optimization: Implement optimization algorithms to find the best combination of parameters or solutions that maximize or minimize a specific objective.
This can be useful when decisions involve multiple parameters and complex trade-offs.

11. Natural Language Processing (NLP) Integration: Incorporate NLP techniques to analyze and process textual data related to decision-making,
such as user reviews, feedback, or expert opinions. This can provide additional insights and context to aid decision-making.

## Normalizers
Logarithmic: Implement a normalizer that applies a logarithmic transformation to the input value. 
This can be useful when there is a wide range of values, and you want to compress them to a smaller range. 
The logarithmic normalizer could emphasize smaller differences between values at the lower end of the scale.

Exponential: Create a normalizer that applies an exponential transformation to the input value. 
This normalizer can be useful when you want to amplify differences between values at the higher end of the scale, giving more weight to larger values.

Z-score: Implement a normalizer that calculates the z-score of the input value based on a distribution of values. 
The z-score normalizer can help in comparing values based on their deviation from the mean, taking into account the variability of the dataset.

Sigmoid: Implement a normalizer that applies a sigmoid function to the input value. The sigmoid normalizer can compress the input range while still preserving some differences between values. 
This can be useful when you want to emphasize values around the mid-range while compressing extreme values.


### Weights

Make sure to provide users with an intuitive interface to assign weights to parameters and clearly communicate the impact of weights on the overall evaluation. 
Additionally, consider offering options for sensitivity analysis or optimization algorithms that can help users explore the effects of different weight configurations on the decision outcomes.
